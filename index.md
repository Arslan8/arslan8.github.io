I am an assistant professor in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eecs.psu.edu/">CSE Departmant</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.psu.edu/">PennState</a>.
I graduated from Purdue University, where i was part of <a target="_blank" href="http://friends.cs.purdue.edu">FRIENDS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://pursec.cs.purdue.edu">PurSec</a> labs under the guidance of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dxu/">Prof. Dongyan Xu</a> and
                         <a target="_blank" href="https://davejingtian.org/">Prof. Dave (Jing) Tian</a>. Other than that I also work closely with <a target="_blank" href="https://antoniobianchi.me/"> Prof. Antonio Bianchi</a>.

My research focuses on advancing the fields of systems and security by exploring innovative architectures and uncovering critical security vulnerabilities in confidential computing and operating systems. I specialize in resource-constrained environments, particularly embedded systems, which power a wide range of critical domains, including automotive, industrial control systems, and robotics. My goal is to develop secure by design, efficient solutions that drive the future of these cutting-edge technologies.
