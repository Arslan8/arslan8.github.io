I am a Ph.D. student in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/">Department of Computer Science </a> at Purdue University. I work in <a target="_blank" href="http://friends.cs.purdue.edu">FRIENDS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://pursec.cs.purdue.edu">PurSec</a> labs under the guidance of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dxu/">Prof. Dongyan Xu</a> and
                         <a target="_blank" href="https://davejingtian.org/">Prof. Dave (Jing) Tian</a>. Other than that I also work closely with <a target="_blank" href="https://antoniobianchi.me/"> Prof. Antonio Bianchi</a>.  My research interest lies in the area of systems and security. In particular, I am interested in identifying novel architectures and security issues in confidential computing and operating systems.
